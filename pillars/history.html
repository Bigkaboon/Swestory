            <p>
              Sweden is the fifth largest country in Europe and is the largest
              in the Scandinavian bloc. Located in Northern Europe, it has land
              borders with Norway in the west, and Finland in the northeast,
              while sharing maritime borders with Germany, Poland, Russia,
              Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Sweden enjoys 3,218 km (2,000 mi)
              of coastline, much of it in the Baltic Sea. The landscape of
              Sweden is dotted with hills, mountains, streams and lakes, the
              largest of which is Lake Vänern. On the Norwegian border is the
              Scandinavian mountain chain, which hosts the highest peak in
              Sweden. This peak, known as Kebnekaise, reaches 2,104 m (6,903 ft)
              in height. Sweden has a total of 25 provinces, the northernmost
              being Lapland. This province extends well into the Arctic Circle
              and parts of it have been named a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
              Stockholm is the capital of Sweden and is the most populous city
              in the Nordic region. The cultural, political and economic centre
              of Sweden, Stockholm is interestingly spread across fourteen
              islands that are part of the Stockholm archipelago.

                We all know karma matters, right? Well, Karma can also transform
                food waste from a problem to an opportunity. Some Swedish
                entrepreneurs have launched an app called Karma. Via the app,
                supermarkets, restaurants and cafés can offer products that are
                about to expire at half price, instead of throwing them away. In
                just two years, Karma claims to have attracted 1.4 million users
                around Sweden as well as in the UK and France. Reducing food
                waste is also on the government’s agenda. ‘More to do more’ is
                an action plan developed by the Swedish Environmental Protection
                Agency, the National Food Agency and the Swedish Board of
                Agriculture. The aim is reduced food waste on a national level
                by 2030.

              <h5>Pacemaker</h5>
              <p>
                In 1958, Rune Elmqvist developed a battery-run artificial
                pacemaker, which was used for the very first pacemaker operation
                done by surgeon Åke Senning at Karolinska University Hospital in
                Stockholm. The pacemaker is placed under the heart patient’s
                skin and the electrical pulses it generates ensure that muscles
                expand and contract normally, regulating the heart.

                Now a standard requirement in every passenger vehicle saving
                around one life every six minutes, the three-point seatbelt was
                developed by Swedish inventor and safety engineer Nils Bohlin in
                1959 for Volvo. It’s designed with a Y shape to spread out
                energy across a moving body during an accident.

              <p>
                The modern-day zip as we know it was improved upon and developed
                by Swedish–American inventor Gideon Sundbäck from an earlier
                less effective model in 1913. Sundbäck’s newly redesigned
                version called the ‘separable fastener’ was patented in 1917 and
                features interlocking teeth pulled together and apart by a
                slider.

              <h5>The walking frame</h5>
              <p>
                Swedish social scientist Aina Wifalk contracted polio – a virus
                that can cause temporary or permanent paralysis – at the age of
                21. After tearing her shoulders from using walking sticks for
                two decades, she came up with the walking frame, or walker, an
                invention that has made life easier for elderly and disabled
                people since the late 1970s. Because Wifalk wanted the walker to
                be accessible to as many people as possible, she never patented
                it. To this day, the walker helps your grandparents stay mobile
                and active.
