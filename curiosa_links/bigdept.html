        <h2>The great debt</h2>
        <p>
          According to a government-owned media source named svt whitch is short
          for "Sveriges telivition" the debt is close to 2.7 billion kr whitch
          is equivillant to 225 532 516,46â‚¬ at the time of writing this
          (2023-09-18). The debt is from when North Korea placed a massive order
          of 1.000 Volvo 144 cars and a great bouquet of other Swedish products.
          The year was 1973 and Sweden had hopes to earn some money after the
          end of the korea war whitch resulted in Sweden being the first western
          country to announce North Korea as "People's Republic of North Korea".
          The year after that it was time for buisness, that was the plan at
          least.
